To open recalcitrant backup:
1. dump to sql. in cmd window:
    $echo .dump | sqlite3.exe bkupFile.db > backupAsSQL.sql
2. create db from sql. in cmd window:
    sqlite3 -init sqlFile.sql outputDBNewName.db
3. Set the db version.  Need to check the db version in DailyDoDatabaseHelper.java for the backup date.
   In sqlite3 (replace 15 with the needed version):
    pragma user_version 15;
4. copy db to device and restore from it.

bug: select row throws error


move table base and adapter base to the general db package

delete db to get rid of values.unitType
